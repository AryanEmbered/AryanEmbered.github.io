the plan is to have a folder and a few icons on the side along with a video or 
something showing my projects.

maybe having some design application would be nice


alright, the icons on the left area are



certificates and marksheets
linkedin
github profile, 
resume pdf
ongoing projects



The next thing I need to do is add a javascript file
